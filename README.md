 OVERVIEW:
 An electric vehicle is one that operates on an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine, which generates power by burning a mix of fuel and gases.
 Electric vehicles (EVs) are a promising technology for achieving a sustainable transport sector in the future, due to their very low to zero carbon emissions, low noise, high efficiency, and flexibility in grid operation and integration.
 It is environmental friendly. Zero exhaust emissions—EVs do not produce any exhaust emissions during operation.
 In India the current market share of EV/HEV/PHEV is around 0.1%.
 Electrical vehicle industry exhibited a rise of 11.34% in 2020 as compared to 2019.
 India is a country which imports around 70% of oil required per year.

The recent scenario of the road transportation sector can be highlighted as:
 
Energy consumption Vehicle to people ratio: 524 million tons of oil equivalent 
Vehicle to people ratio: 1:56.3
Per capita energy: 442 kg of oil equivalent
GHG emissions: 1730 million tons of CO2 equivalent 
Electric Vehicles sold: 25000 (all) and 2000 (cars)

Market segmentation analysis is important for understanding the needs and preferences of different customer segments and developing effective marketing strategies to target those segments. Market segmentation becomes a crucial tool for evolving transportation technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) in emerging markets to explore and implement for extensive adoption.

EVs adoption is expected to grow phenomenally in near future as low emission and low operating cost vehicle, and thus, it drives a considerable amount of forthcoming academic research curiosity.

 MARKET OVERVIEW: Electric vehicle market segmentation:
 Vehicle type
 Power source type

The India electric vehicle market size was valued at USD 220.1 million in 2020 and is
expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 94.4% from 2021 to
2030. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a significant decline in the overall
sales of passenger and commercial vehicles in 2020. However, the sales of electric vehicles in
India remained unaffected. The post-lockdown sale of pure and hybrid electric vehicles is a
prominent driving factor for the electric vehicle market in India

The Indian Electric Vehicle Market has been impacted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic due to supply chain disruptions and halt of manufacturing units due to continuous lockdowns and travel restrictions across the country. However, the electric vehicle (EV) market is still in its nascent stage in India. It is expected to grow at a much faster rate during the forecast period due to various government initiatives and policies.
